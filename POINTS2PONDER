Interaction Complexity: Currently, a click means "Treated" (Green). Therapists often need to record "Pain" (Red) vs "Treated" (Green). We need to decide how to handle this in a browser.

Option A: Left Click (Green), Right Click (Red). (Hard on mobile).

Option B: A "Mode Toggle" switch at the top (Treatment Mode vs. Assessment Mode). (Safest for mobile).

PDF Strategy: Do we need to output data to be imported into another system (CSV/JSON), or just the visual PDF? The "Superbill" requirement implies a visual PDF, but some billers prefer raw data.

Local Persistence: If the user refreshes the page right now, they lose their notes. We should implement localStorage immediately in the next session to prevent data loss during accidental refreshes.

The PDF Challenge:

Generating a PDF is heavier than text. We need to decide: Do we generate it in the browser (Client-Side) or send data to a server (Server-Side)?

Jim's Recommendation: Client-side using pdf-lib. It keeps patient data on their device (privacy-friendly) and costs us $0 in server fees.

Customization:

Therapists have their own "voice." Currently, the phrases "Tolerated well" and "Palpable release" are hardcoded. We should consider a "Settings" panel where they can save their own preferred phrases.

Mobile Ergonomics:

Now that the logic works, we need to see how it feels on a phone. The "Front/Back" buttons might be too small for a thumb. We might need to move them to a bottom navigation bar.
