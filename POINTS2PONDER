. POINTS TO PONDER (For Next Session)
Interaction Complexity: Currently, a click means "Treated" (Green). Therapists often need to record "Pain" (Red) vs "Treated" (Green). We need to decide how to handle this in a browser.

Option A: Left Click (Green), Right Click (Red). (Hard on mobile).

Option B: A "Mode Toggle" switch at the top (Treatment Mode vs. Assessment Mode). (Safest for mobile).

PDF Strategy: Do we need to output data to be imported into another system (CSV/JSON), or just the visual PDF? The "Superbill" requirement implies a visual PDF, but some billers prefer raw data.

Local Persistence: If the user refreshes the page right now, they lose their notes. We should implement localStorage immediately in the next session to prevent data loss during accidental refreshes.

Ready when you are, partner.
