Date: February 12, 2026
Team: Jim (AI) & Partner (Human)
====================================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Goal: Create a frictionless, sub-second session documentation tool for an Occupational Therapist specializing in Myofascial Release (MFR).
Output: SOAP-formatted notes optimized for CPT 97140 (Manual Therapy) billing.
Core Philosophy: Speed over flash. "The Middle Ground" approach.

2. ARCHITECTURE & TECH STACK
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript.
- Visuals: Hand-coded "Low-Poly" SVG Mannequin (Zone-based interaction).
- Data Engine: Hybrid approach.
  - "Click-to-Copy" for legacy billing systems.
  - PDF Overlay (via pdf-lib) for generating official CMS-1500/Superbills.
- Future State (SaaS): Multi-tenant architecture with user authentication.

3. CURRENT PROGRESS
- [COMPLETED] Defined "Middle Ground" strategy (Zones vs. Anatomy).
- [COMPLETED] Created basic HTML/CSS Skeleton (3-Column Layout).
- [COMPLETED] Implemented Interactive SVG Mannequin (Front/Back views).
- [COMPLETED] Built basic Logic Engine (Click muscle -> Generate Text).
- [COMPLETED] Added "Future-Proofing" placeholders for Auth/Security.

4. PENDING DECISIONS / NEXT STEPS
- [NEXT] Implement local storage to save "Defaults" (e.g., favorite phrases).
- [NEXT] Refine the "Pain" vs "Treatment" click logic (Left vs Right click?).
- [NEXT] Begin PDF generation logic.
