- Visuals: Hand-coded "Low-Poly" SVG Mannequin (Zone-based interaction).
- Data Engine: Hybrid approach.
  - "Click-to-Copy" for legacy billing systems.
  - PDF Overlay (via pdf-lib) for generating official CMS-1500/Superbills.
- Future State (SaaS): Multi-tenant architecture with user authentication.

4. PENDING DECISIONS / NEXT STEPS
- [NEXT] Implement local storage to save "Defaults" (e.g., favorite phrases).
- [NEXT] Refine the "Pain" vs "Treatment" click logic (Left vs Right click?).
- [NEXT] Begin PDF generation logic.
