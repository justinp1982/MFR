PROJECT CONTEXT & STATE - v1.3 (Golden Master)
Date: February 13, 2026
Team: Jim (AI) & Partner (Human)
====================================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Goal: Create a frictionless, sub-second session documentation tool for an Occupational Therapist specializing in Myofascial Release (MFR).
Output: SOAP-formatted notes optimized for CPT 97140 (Manual Therapy) billing.
Core Philosophy: Speed over flash. "The Middle Ground" approach.

2. ARCHITECTURE & TECH STACK
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript.
- Visuals: Hand-coded "Low-Poly" SVG Mannequin (Zone-based interaction).
- Data Engine: 
  - State Management: Dual-Array System (Pain vs. Treated).
  - Persistence: LocalStorage (Auto-save on every click).
  - Output: Realtime SOAP text generation + Tabular Billing Data.

3. CURRENT PROGRESS (v1.3 STABLE)
- [COMPLETED] "Middle Ground" SVG Map (Front/Back views).
- [COMPLETED] Logic Engine: Pain Mode (Red) vs. Treatment Mode (Green).
- [COMPLETED] Billing Integration: "Superbill Data" tab with CPT codes.
- [COMPLETED] Persistence: Session data survives page refreshes.
- [COMPLETED] Workflow: "New Session" reset functionality.

4. RECENT HISTORY & STRATEGY
- We attempted a jump to v1.4 (Mobile/PDF/Settings) but encountered stability issues.
- We ROLLED BACK to v1.3 to establish a stable baseline.
- CURRENT STRATEGY: Implement v1.4 features one by one, starting with Mobile Ergonomics, then Settings, then PDF.

5. NEXT STEPS
- [IMMEDIATE] Mobile Polish: Add CSS Media Queries for phone layout.
- [PENDING] Customization: Settings modal for therapist phrases.
- [PENDING] PDF Generation: Client-side using `jspdf`.

- No server or database is required for this phase.

2. KEY FEATURES DELIVERED

4. NEXT STEPS (Post-PoC)
- Deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Field Test: Therapist uses it for 1 day in the clinic.
- Feedback Loop: Does "Global Settings" cover 90% of cases?
